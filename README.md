# ENEL645_PlantDiseaseDetection

This repository is for Team 2's ENEL 645 final project. In this project the team utilized existing datasets to develop a plant health detection algorithm with deep learning. The deep learning architecture is TensorFlow, written with Python code, while the data will be displayed with Keras. The dataset used was obtained from the Kaggle PlantVillage datset.

Please use the below outline to navigate through files in this repository.
## ENEL 645 Final Project Files:
The model files are stored in Models_folder
The Generalized dataset taken from the internet is stored in the General_Validation_Dataset folder. These images are not the Kaggle dataset. 
The Kaggle dataset was too large to put into this repo please refer to the final report for the URL ro the Kaggle dataset.
