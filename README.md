# ENEL645_PlantDiseaseDetection

This repository is for Team 2's ENEL 645 final project. In this project the team utilized existing datasets to develop a plant health detection algorithm with deep learning. The deep learning architecture is TensorFlow, written with Python code, while the data will be displayed with Keras. The dataset used was obtained from the Kaggle PlantVillage datset.
