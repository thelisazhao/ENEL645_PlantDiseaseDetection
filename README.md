# ENEL645_PlantDiseaseDetection

This repository is for Team 2's ENEL 645 final project. In this project the team will utilize existing datasets to develop a plant health detection algorithm using deep learning. The deep learning architecture will be TensorFlow, written with Python code, while the data will be displayed with Keras. The dataset used was obtained from the Kaggle PlantVillage datset.
